  APIs are great, and writing code to use them is probably something many of us do a lot.
  This software is for those of us who want to write isolated tests for our code that
  consumes HTTP based APIs.  You can use sham-http to roll your own mock HTTP or HTTPS
  server, which runs in process with your code.  We also have prebuilt some API mocks such
  as Salesforce and Jira.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://sham.software" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
